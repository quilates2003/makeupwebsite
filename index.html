				<h2>What is makeup?</h2>

				the face.Cosmetics applied to the face to enhance its appearance are often called make-up or makeup. Common make-up items include:

				<h2>Why is it important to know you skin type?</h2>
				<p>Our skin has a big role in a makeup routine. It does affect the makeup that will apply on your face. A good preparation 
				before applying your makeup makes it last for a whole day. For dry skin, it is important to get moisturized before applying 
				the base makeup like foundation, otherwise, your makeup will cake up - the result of too dry application that leads to 
				cracking of the base makeup. For oily skin, find good products that will help to lessen the excretion of oil on the face. 
				For sensitive skin, it's best to use hypoallergenic makeup to make sure of the safety for a sensitive skin. For combination 
				skin, put moisturizer on the areas that are dry, and put powder to set the areas that are oily. For normal skin, there is no 
				significant problems to be concern on.</p>

				<h2>How does climate affects your makeup?</h2>
				<p>Climate affects makeup in its longevity especially living in a humid weather like Philippines, it's always important to use 
				the right products to make your makeup last all day. Most of Filipinos are having oily skin, it's really hard for them to make 
				their makeup last because of the sebum and oil produced by our glands in the face that easily take off the makeup. To avoid this, 
				always set your makeup with powder. For oily skin, baking helps to make your makeup last longer because it prevents oil from producing 
				quickly.</p>
